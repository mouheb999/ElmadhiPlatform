/**
 * Proof — the part of the sales flow that is not ours to write.
 *
 * ## Testimonials
 *
 * `TESTIMONIALS` ships **empty**, and every component that renders it hides
 * itself when it is. That is deliberate and it is not a placeholder to be
 * filled in with plausible-sounding names before launch.
 *
 * A testimonial is a claim that a named person said a thing and got a result.
 * Inventing one to put on a page that takes money is fraud, in Tunisia as
 * everywhere else, and it is also bad business: this product sells to a small
 * market where people recognise each other's names and can check. One real
 * quote from one real customer outperforms five invented ones, because the
 * fifth invented one is the reason nobody believes the other four.
 *
 * So: fill this in from people who actually trained on the plan, with their
 * permission, in their words. Three is plenty to start. Until there are three,
 * the funnel argues with the product instead — which is what the walkable
 * preview on /checkout is for.
 *
 * ## What is here instead
 *
 * `PROOF_POINTS` are statements about what the app does. Every one of them is
 * checkable against the code, and the components that show them sit where a
 * testimonial carousel would. They are not social proof and do not pretend to
 * be; they are the mechanism, said plainly, which is the honest thing to lead
 * with before there are customers to quote.
